              <p><em>As a member of the "Bonded Abrasives - Vitrified" department at Saint-Gobain Research North America, my primary task was related to the development of a fully automated machine for precision manufacturing of abrasive grinding wheels in a factory setting. Traditionally the process of preparing abrasive blanks for pressing is done by hand and variations in material deposition across the area of the sample can result in uneven hardness, negatively impacting end-product performance and lifespan. Ultimately the device I designed and built reduced deviations in hardness as a result of manufacturing across a given sample by over 50%. To enable manual and autonomous operation in a plant environment, I designed a robust, environmentally isolated electrical panel to house power and control electronics. In addition to all the necessary control software in C++ to operate the device both manually and autonomously, I also wrote a mathematical model of sediment deposition in Python to optimize consistency across manufactured blocks with precise pathing. The device operated on an XY gantry made of linear rails to ensure precise control and vibrationally deposited abrasive particulate mix to form abrasive blanks. Separate from this project I deployed 5 independently designed and fabricated calibration and testing devices using 3D-printing in a full-scale factory setting.</em></p>

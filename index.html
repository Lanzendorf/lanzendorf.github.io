Open for full-time mechanical engineering positions
<br>
<br>
I'm a mechanical engineer with an interest in mechatronics, robotics, and additive manufacturing to name a few. In my freetime I enjoy taking on new engineering projects, applying all my technical skills and picking up some new ones along the way too. I have over eight years of experience in design (primarily with Solidworks and Onshape) and love working with machines to bring designs to life whether that be 3D printing, manual-, or CNC-machining.
<br>
<br>
Currently I am working at General Dynamics Electric Boat in the Future Plant Studies Fluids department where I am the owner of several nuclear reactor fluid systems, developing these systems in their entirety to support the development of the next generation of nuclear submarines. In June of 2024, I earned my degree in Mechanical Engineering with a concentration in Robotics from the California Institute of Technology. In my time at Caltech I was heavily involved in our school's robotic rover team competing on an international level and served as a TA for several classes with focuses in design, manufacturing, prototyping, robotics, and mechatronics.

 I am looking to transition to a new position with a focus
